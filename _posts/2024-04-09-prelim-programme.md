As the first meeting of this type for the ISMRM we plan to try a range of interaction models. The main meeting in Singapore is 8 hrs ahead of the UK which will limit live viewing during normal hours. We have confirmed that talks are available near immediately after they have finished. Each day of the meeting will begin by watching a plenary talk and the accompanying session. On the last day we will watch the Mansfield lecture live. There will be opportunities for individual watching of talks or in small groups should a particular interest group attend. Educational sessions will also be watched collectively and will be chosen based on the interests of the registrants.
