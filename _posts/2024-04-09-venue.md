The meeting will take place using the conference facilities at [Sudbury House Hotel][SudburyHouseLink] in Faringdon, Oxfordshire. We will have access to a room which would be suitable for lecture style seating and a room where we could sit more comfortably on sofas. This enables us to have some sessions where we can watch together, e.g. plenary sessions in the mornings, combined with watching educational and scientific talks/sessions, and a room where attendees can sit comfortably in a room with sofas. The aim being to retain some collective experience of attending the ISMRM without the distraction of virtual attendance at home or in our normal place of work.
