subtitle: The ICP Network was created as a result of the Imaging Cerebral Physiology Symposium held in Leipzig in December 2014. At the symposium, attendees discussed the possibility of creating a network for the development and promotion of MR techniques for quantitative imaging of cerebral physiology. This network brings together experts who develop and use techniques such as calibrated fMRI and cerebrovascular reactivity mapping to study brain physiology in health and disease. By consolidating our efforts, the network aims to give this field new opportunities for fruitful collaborations and to provide greater visibility for these techniques.
