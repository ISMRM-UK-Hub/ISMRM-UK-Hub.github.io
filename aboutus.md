subtitle: What is the ISMRM UK Hub?
---

The aim of this first ISMRM UK hub is to give virtual registrants of the annual meeting of the ISMRM some of the in-person benefits of a conference but without travelling to Singapore. We believe there are many reasons people may choose to register virtually including environmental, responsibilities or disabilities that donâ€™t allow travel, visa issues and insufficient funding. We have been in contact with the ISMRM central office and we have their full blessing to run a hub meeting in the UK, alongside a similar meeting being planned in Germany. We have also received funding from the BIC ISMRM to provide financial support for the attendance of trainee members.
