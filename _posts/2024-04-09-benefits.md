There are many benefits to attending a UK hub that go beyond the advantages of an in-person meeting. Firstly, there's the reduced cost. We calculated the cost of attending a UK Hub in Oxfordshire based on travel from Nottingham, as an example, to be 50% less than attending the meeting in Singapore. Secondly, there's the reduced travel time. We calculated the travel time from Nottingham, as an example, to be reduced by 80%. Finally, there's the reduced carbon emissions. We calculated a reduction of 99% in carbon emissions based on an average petrol car and no passengers. Travel by train is 6 times better!
